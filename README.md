# useful-components
This contains components designed to work with the Vassar WordPress parent theme. They're intended to integrate into any design;
you shouldn't need anything other than what is specified for each project. The Javascript libraries each component requires are built into vassar-parent-theme, and can be activated in the child theme's functions.php file.

The goal here is to collect together re-usable components, along with instructions on how to implement them in vassar-parent-theme-based projects.
